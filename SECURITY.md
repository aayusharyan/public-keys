## Reporting a key compromise or issue

If you believe one of the public keys in this repository has been compromised, revoked, or is being misused:

1. **Do not** open a public issue — that would advertise the situation.
2. Prefer contacting me through a private channel (e.g. another verified contact method you already have).
3. If you must use GitHub: use the repo's **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability** so the report stays private (do not open a public issue).

I will revoke and replace any key that is compromised and update this repository accordingly.

## What these keys are for

These are **public** keys only. They are meant for:

- Verifying signatures I make (e.g. commits, tags).
- Encrypting data or messages to me.
- Allowing SSH access to servers where I have added the corresponding public key.
- Identifying or allowing access to homelab machines (keys in homelab-keys.txt).

You should not trust a key solely because it appears here. Verify the fingerprint through another channel (e.g. in person, verified website, or a trusted keyserver) when it matters.
