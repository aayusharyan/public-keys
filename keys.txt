# My personal public keys
#
# Format:
# - SSH public keys (Ed25519, RSA, ECDSA, etc.): one key per line.
#   Lines starting with 'ssh-ed25519', 'ssh-rsa', 'ecdsa-sha2-*' are SSH keys.
# - GPG public keys: full ASCII-armored blocks between
#   -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
#   and
#   -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
#
# This file can contain both; tools only read the format they understand.
#
# If this file is used directly as ~/.ssh/authorized_keys: OpenSSH ignores
# lines starting with # and skips non-SSH lines (e.g. GPG blocks). Only
# SSH key lines are used for login.
#
# My keys are listed below (I am the only one who edits this file).
