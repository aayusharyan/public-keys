# Contributing

This repository contains **my personal public keys** and **my homelab’s public keys** only. It is not intended for contributions of code or keys from others.

So:

- **Please do not** open pull requests to add your own keys here. Publish your keys in your own repo or keyserver.
- **Please do not** open pull requests to “fix” or replace my keys unless we have agreed elsewhere (e.g. after a rotation or compromise).
- If you spot a typo or broken link in the docs (README, SECURITY, etc.), a small PR or issue is fine, but key changes are at my discretion.

Thanks for understanding.
